    - **Non-Dealer Mode**: Select all winners, enter the "Amount Won" for winners (chips received from each loser). If a loser's loss is different from "Amount Won", enter it in "Amount Lost"; otherwise leave it blank.
4. Click **Calculation** to update totals.
5. See the **Usage** button on the site for detailed instructions.
